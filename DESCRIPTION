Description: An implementation of a non-parametric resampling technique in the context of 
    multidimensional hypothesis testing of assumptions of the Rasch model based on conditional 
    distributions. It is suggested in small sample size scenarios, in which asymptotic theory 
    is not applicable, to approximate the exact sampling distribution of various well-known 
    Chi^2 test statistics like Wald, likelihood ratio, score and gradient tests as well as 
    others. A procedure to compute the power function of the tests is also presented. A number 
    of examples of scenarios are discussed in which the power function does not converge to one 
    with an increasing deviation from the hypothesis to be tested, i.e. the respective assumption 
    of the model. Finally, an attempt to modify the critical region of the test is made aiming 
    at improving the power.
